The platform represented a leap forward in leveraging AI for the legal industry way before ChatGPT came along.In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted markets globally, we were forced to halt Aflux AI’s operations before launching to market. This challenging period became a turning point, offering an opportunity to reassess and innovate.In 2021, I pivoted the company to Vambora, transforming it into a fintech startup with a mission to address cross-border financial inclusivity. Leveraging Open Banking data, we developed a Digital ID platform for credit adjudication, enabling access to over 5,000 financial institutions across 26 countries.Key Achievements with Vambora:- Designed scalable, regulatory-compliant fintech solutions tailored to the needs of underbanked and immigrant populations.- Built partnerships across financial institutions and major fintech companies (Neo Financial and KOHO) ecosystems to enable global financial access.- Navigated complex challenges in compliance, scalability, and product development, ensuring user needs remained at the core of every decision.In 2024, despite the team’s dedication and the product’s potential, we were unable to secure the necessary funding to continue the project."
